Description: Pluralize a word
 This package works only for English language currently.
 Default:
     - Irregular nouns will use this [list]
       (https://github.com/sindresorhus/irregular-plurals/
                blob/master/irregular-plurals.json).
     - Words ending in *s*, *x*, *z*, *ch*, *sh*
       will be pluralized with *-es* (eg. *foxes*).
     - Words ending in *y* that are preceded by a consonant
       will be pluralized by replacing *y* with *-ies* (eg. *puppies*).
     - All other words will have "s" added to the end (eg. *days*).
 Pluralized word.
 The plural suffix will match the case of the last letter in the word.
 This option is only for extreme edge-cases. You probably won't need it.
